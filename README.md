# Onboarding

## About

We're open sourcing CS foreach's projects!

The intention is to create an open library of workshops that decompose larger projects into various workshops. For example, if we were to create a game, we could encapsulate out different components to teach about Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures or about Algorithms, etc. Or we could scale this project to different grade levels.

Additionally, we're starting a branch of self-paced tutorial projects under the Curriculum Asyncrhonous branch.
